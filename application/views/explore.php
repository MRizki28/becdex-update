                            <h3>History of the Blue Economy</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                            The blue economy is a design for optimizing water resources that aims to increase economic growth through various innovative and creative activities while ensuring business and environmental sustainability.
                            </p>
                            <p align="justify">
                            The term blue economy was first introduced in 2010 by Gunter Pauli through his book entitled The Blue Economy: 10 years – 100 innovations – 100 million jobs. The blue economy applies ecosystem logic, namely ecosystems that lead to higher levels of efficiency to flow nutrients and energy without waste to meet the basic needs of all contributors in a system. Furthermore, the blue economy focuses on innovation and creativity which includes product diversity, efficiency of production systems, and structuring of resource management systems.
                            </p>
                            <p align="justify">
                            Since the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea through Law Number 17 of 1985 concerning Ratification of the United Nations Convention. The marine economic development policy is a marine economic development with a blue economy model for the realization of Indonesia as an archipelagic country that is independent, advanced, strong and based on national interests. The blue economy continues and is always associated with the development of coastal areas. The blue economy concept is the same as the green economy concept which is environmentally friendly by focusing on developing countries that have sea areas, which are commonly referred to as Small Island Development States (SIDS). In this case the blue economy is directed at overcoming the problem of hunger, reducing poverty, creating sustainable marine biota, reducing disaster risk in coastal areas, as well as mitigating and adapting to climate change.
